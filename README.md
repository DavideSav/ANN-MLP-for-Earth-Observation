## Description

Pixel-based image classification of Copernicus imagery (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) using a Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network. Image preprocessing was performed using the Science Toolbox Exploitation Platform (SNAP), while classification was conducted with the Neumapper software provided by GEO-K company.
